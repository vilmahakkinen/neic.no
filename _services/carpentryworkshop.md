Carpentries workshops focus on creating a motivating and engaging environment for learners with no or little digital skills while our regular CodeRefinery three-day workshops are the next step.
NeIC is a Platinum member organzitation within _The Carpentries_, allowing us to request for up to 6 workshops coordinated centrally by The Carpentries per membership year free of charge for administration fee of 2500 USD, as long as instructor travel costs are covered. Any further centrally organized workshops get a 50% reduction in workshop fee.

## Access policy
Eligable NeIC members to apply are: IT Center for Science Ltd (CSC) in Finland, Computing Services University of Iceland (CSUI), Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation (DeiC), Estonian Scientific Computing Infrastructure (ETAIS), Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) and UNINETT Sigma2 AS in Norway. Your (academic) home institution should be coupled to one of those national e-infrastructure providers.

Please contact the regional Carpentries coordinator for the Nordic and Baltics region, [Naoe Tatara](https://neic.no/people/naoe-tatara/) if you want to get a local Carpentries workshop through NeIC's membership within The Carpentries.
