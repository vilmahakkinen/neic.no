Carpentries workshops focus on creating a motivating and engaging environment for learners with no or little digital skills while our regular CodeRefinery three-day workshops are the next step.
NeIC is a Platinum member organzitation within _The Carpentries_, allowing us to self-organize and unlimited amount of Carpentries workshops with no additional workshop fees as long as the agreement is into effect. We are also entitled to 6 workshops coordinated centrally by The Carpentries per year including with outside instructors as long as instructor travel costs are covered. Any further centrally organized workshops get a 50% reduction in workshop fee.
