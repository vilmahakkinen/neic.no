<h2>Overview</h2>Abacus 2.0 is a supercomputer with 14,016 processor cores. It may be used for a broad spectrum of demanding data processing workloads.

## Access policy
Access to the facility
The DeiC National HPC Center, SDU, hosts state-of-the-art solutions for academic HPC suitable for a wide range of research and technological applications. All researchers at Danish universities and all academic users can benefit from the available resources under the same conditions.

Access to the facility is not free of charge. All academic users, independently of their host institution pay the same price. This allows all researchers at Danish universities to equally take advantage of the partial public funding for the national facility at SDU.

The ABACUS2.0 supercomputer is currently one of the most power efficient HPC installation in the Nordic countries and offers one of the best pricing options for academic users in Europe, also thanks to the national funding from DeiC.

Users are billed according to how many node hours they are allocated on the ABACUS2.0 supercomputer. This means that node hours not used by the applicant, within the agreed time frame, will not be refunded.

Access to the HPC facility, the allocated resources as well as the appropriate user support are provided within the scope and the limits of the HPC Centre policies and regulations.

Three Danish universities — AAU, AU and SDU — have committed themselves to buying HPC resources for a total amount of 21M DKK. AU has committed to buy 5M DKK over 4 years (March 2015-February 2019). AAU has committed to buy 0.25M DKK resources every year over 4 years (March 2015-February 2019). The Rector of SDU has set aside 15M DKK for the period 2015-2018 to (co)finance access to computational resources on the HPC facility by SDU researchers.
