The SNIC Science Cloud (SSC) is a community cloud and use of the resources is free of charge to Swedish PIs and their collaborators. As for other SNIC allocations you need an affiliation with a Swedish higher education institution to be eligible to apply for a project.

The SSC resources are not meant to be a replacement of SNIC’s supercomputing resources (HPC clusters). Rather, it should be seen as a complement, offering advanced functionality to users who need more flexible access to resources (for example more control over the operating systems and software environments), want to develop software as a service, or want to explore recent technology such as for “Big Data” (e.g. Apache Hadoop/Spark) or IoT applications.
