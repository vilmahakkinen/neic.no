<p>Rocket cluster is a general purpose HPC cluster under SLURM management. The main part of the Rocket cluster consists of 135 compute nodes, two compute nodes with GPUs and a headnode. In addition to these nodes, there is a large memory machine with 2TB of RAM and two GPFS filesystem servers, which will provide fast storage for the entire cluster. All the machines mentioned above are connected to a fast Infiniband 4X QDR fabric.</p>
