This is a fully fledged 5-day training event which will provide the much needed foundational skills for competent data stewards and data managers in the Nordic countries with knowledge of the FAIR principles and their practical application. The courses are held by two highly skilled trainers from GO-FAIR and provides a broad but fairly technical introduction to data stewardship.
