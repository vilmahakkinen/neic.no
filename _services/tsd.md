The TSD – Service for Sensitive Data, is a platform for collecting, storing, analyzing and sharing sensitive data in compliance with the norwegian privacy regulation.
TSD is used by researchers working at UiO and in other public research institutions (the UH-sector, universities, hospitals etc.). The TSD is primarily an IT-platform for research even if in some cases it is used for clinical research and commercial research.
TSD is developed and operated by UiO and is a part of NorStore, the national infrastructure for handling and storage of scientific data.
