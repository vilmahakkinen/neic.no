Update from the Nordic High Performance Computing & Applications Workshop in Iceland
===========================

**On the 13-15 of june 2018, the University of Iceland hosted the 2nd Nordic High Performance Computing & Applications Workshop, a 
three-day long event featuring HPC experts and domain scientists from Iceland, the U.S. and Germany. During the workshop, particpants
discussed topics ranging from project experiences to technology tutorials.**

This free cross-national training workshop was the second of its kind, supported by NeIC through the Ratatosk Training Programme. The 
training is targeted at scientists and e-Infrastructure personnel in the Nordic region, however, participants were mostly affiliated to 
Icelandic research institutions. Technical talks covered cloud computing, machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering 
concepts, while users shared experiences from earth sciences, physics and healthcare domains. Hands-on exercises and a tour of the
Icelandic HPC cluster ensured a practice-oriented perspective for the 23 registered participants.

The pool of speakers contained the following people:
- Helmut Neukirchen from the University of Iceland School of Engineering and Natural Sciences
- Kuo Kwo-Sen from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
- Lars Hoffmann from the Jülich Supercomputing Centre
- Máni Maríus Viðarsson from the University of Iceland Division of Information Technology
- Matthias Book from the University of Iceland School of Engineering and Natural Sciences
- Morris Riedel from the Jülich Supercomputing Centre and the University of Iceland School of Engineering and Natural Sciences
- Oliver Maaßen from the RWTH Aachen University Hospital
- Rahul Ramachandran from NASA Marshall Space Flight Center
- Viðar Guðmundsson from the University of Iceland Science Institute

For the reader's convenince, Rahul Ramachandran's talk can be viewed [here](https://rec.hi.is/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2669ff9a-fea6-4c12-841f-760152414b73). Mr. Ramachandran talk about supporting analytics in NASA's Earth
Science Data Repository, containing massive amounts of heterogeneous data from diverse observational platforms.
