NeIC 2017 Annual Report
===========================

2017 has been a busy, yet rewarding year for NeIC!

To share with you all the things we have been up to in 2017 we have created the [NeIC 2017 Annual Report](https://wiki.neic.no/w/ext/img_auth.php/3/34/NeIC_Annual_Report_2017_3_spreads.pdf), which gives you all the highlights from 2017. You can read about what our projects have achieved and which impact they have made, which new activities we have been setting up, or learn about our strategy planning process to design a new strategy for 2020-2025, which strategy implementation milestones we achieved during 2017, and our commitment to social responsibility. The report also includes an overview over the 2017 accounts, our workshops and events, as well as the people who worked with us during this year.

You can also find a printer friendly version of the report [here](https://wiki.neic.no/w/ext/img_auth.php/8/80/NeIC_Annual_Report_2017_3_single.pdf)
