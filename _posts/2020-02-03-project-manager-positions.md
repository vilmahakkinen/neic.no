===============================

NeIC is looking for two Project Managers for its two new projects, [Puhuri](https://neic.no/puhuri/) and [NICEST2](https://neic.no/nicest2/). The projects will start during the year 2020.

**Puhuri** will work to enable seamless cross-border service access for Nordic scientists. The first focus is Nordic access to the LUMI resources. For the Puhuri project, we’re seeking a Project Manager to fill a 50% position. The contract period for the position is 2 years. For more information about the role and how to apply please see [here](https://wiki.neic.no/w/ext/img_auth.php/7/7a/200121-Puhuri-Open-position-announcement.docx.pdf). 

**NICEST2** is a continuation of NeIC’s [NICEST](https://neic.no/nicest/) project (Nordic Infrastructure Collaboration for Earth System Modelling Tools). For the NICEST2 Project Manager, the position is 50 % and contract period 3 years. More information about the NICEST2 project can be found [here](https://neic.no/nicest2/), and information about the position and applying [here](https://wiki.neic.no/w/ext/img_auth.php/8/8c/200121-NICEST2-Open-position-announcement-.docx.pdf).

We offer both of these part-time positions primarily to staff at the national e-infrastructure provider institutions and their collaborating organizations. Staff are in this instance contracted to NeIC through a service agreement between the local employer institution and NeIC. We encourage both current NeIC staff and new candidates to apply!
