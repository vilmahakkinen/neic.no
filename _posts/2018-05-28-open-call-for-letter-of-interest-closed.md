The Open Call for Letters of Interest for Collaboration is now closed
===============================

NeIC is preparing a new five-year strategic plan for 2020-2025. In relation to this, NeIC gathered information throughout 2018 about the
directions and goals for e-infrastructure in the Nordic region. The plan will be formulated to provide the clear measurable benefits to
researchers and e-infrastructure providers. This spring we therefore invited input and suggestions from the Nordic research and
e-infrastructure communities in two ways, one for information that will be used by NeIC in the short term (2-3 years) and one for 
information that will be useful in the longer term (>5 years). The open call for ‘Letters of Interest for Collaboration’ and ‘Request for
Information’ were published earlier this spring with the deadline of 15th May. 

We received in total 15 responses to our Open Calls, 6 of these were responses to the [Request for Information](https://neic.no/news/2018/03/22/letters-of-interest/), and 9 were Letters of
Interest for Collaboration. Further details about the responses we received will be posted on the NeIC website shortly.

The deadline for the Letters of Interest for Collaboration has now passed. We still welcome input to the NeIC strategy in the form of 
responses to our Request for Information. Submissions can be sent to neic@neic.no.
