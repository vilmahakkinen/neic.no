Registration for NeIC2019 is now open!
===============================

We are pleased to announce that registrations for NeIC2019 has now opened! NeIC2019 is this year hosted by DeiC and will take place at the Tivoli Hotel & Congress Center in Copenhagen, 14- 16th May. 

The NeIC conferences are organised biannually bringing together around 230 experts, researchers, policy makers, funders and national eIntrastructure providers from the Nordics and beyond. The aim is to create an opportunity for people in the eInfrastructure field to connect and collaborate with colleagues across the Nordics and to enable them to share knowledge and expertise. The title for this year’s event is ‘Nordic Infrastructure for Open Science’. We will take a closer look at how we can collaborate across borders to strengthen the field of Open Science. During the three days of the conference will show examples of Open Science collaborations taking place in the Nordic region, as well as connect what is happening in the Nordics to a larger, international context – in particular the European Open Science Cloud. There will also be range of different technical workshops where you can exchange knowledge and experiences with your colleagues across the Nordic region. 

NeIC2019 is a collaboration between CSC, DeiC, NeIC, RHnet, SNIC, and UNINETT Sigma2.

Please find more information and register for NeIC2019 [here](https://indico.neic.no/event/18/overview). Our discounted early bird registration fee is available until 1st March. 

We hope to see you in Copenhagen in May!
