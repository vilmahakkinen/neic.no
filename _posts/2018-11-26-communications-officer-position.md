# New Communications Officer position open within NeIC

**NeIC is seeking a Communications Officer and/or Web Developer to fill one or more 20-40% positions.**

NeIC is seeking a Communications Officer to support NeICs growing portfolio of projects. During the last few years NeIC has grown at a rapid speed. It now has a significant portfolio of projects that are making a valuable contribution to the e-infrastructure field. Along with this growth, NeIC is presented with the challenge of communicating what it does, its outcomes and impact in a concise and understandable way to stakeholders both inside and outside the e-infrastructure field. We therefore see a need to expand NeICâ€™s communication capacity. 

NeIC is seeking a Communications Officer and/or Web Developer to fill one or more 20-40% positions. The contract period for this position is 3 years. We offer this part-time position primarily to staff at the national e-infrastructure provider institutions and their collaborating organizations. Staff are in this instance contracted to NeIC through a service agreement between the local employer institution and NeIC. 

The ideal candidate has excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as expertise from communication related work, such as updating websites and social media. Candidates are expected to have some experience in website maintenance, or a genuine interest in developing skills in this area. It is also desirable that the candidate has experience in working with, or is motivated to learn, GitHub, or other similar platforms. For such candidates NeIC will offer flexible work arrangement, stimulating colleagues, systematic training and practice in the PPS project model. It is expected that the candidates are employed at a national e-infrastructure organization or one of its collaborating institutions. Candidates must have a good command of English (both written and spoken). The position entails a wide variety of interesting tasks and involve extensive contact with research groups and specialist communities in the Nordic countries and internationally.
