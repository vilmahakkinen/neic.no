### Johanna Törnroos wins the best presentation award at Elixir AHM 2020 

Johanna Törnroos is the winner of the award for the best presentation at the Impact and Innovation Mini-
Symposium during the All Hands Meeting 2020. She presented ‘Impact through Collaboration’ in the Nordics
within The Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) — from exchanging knowledge to increasing
competencies and research quality. She employed an example from the Tryggve2 Project, where NeIC
supports the development of sensitive data management tools used, among others, in assessing the risk of
heritable and familial cancers.

More details and a recording of the presentation can be found on [Elixir Europe website](https://elixir-europe.org/news/johanna-tornroos-wins-best-presentation-award).
