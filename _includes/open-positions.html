      </br> NeIC usually engages staff through service contracts with our partners and, in some cases, on individual basis. Contracts are typically on 20-80% commitment level for 2-4 year increments. We generally engage technical experts and managers for our projects, and look for a broader set of competencies for our executive team. Candidates often have interest in employment with one of our partners which are the national e-Infrastructure organizations in the Nordic countries. We have in the past been able to find workable arrangements for some of these cases. Our working language is English. <b>If you believe you could be a future candidate for us, please submit a CV to gudmund.host@nordforsk.org</b>. <p><br/>
