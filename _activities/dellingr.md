The approach is to work with the national e-infrastructure providers to
define a functional framework for resource sharing that will recognize and build
upon the unique strengths of each provider to advance research in each of the
respective countries and within the Nordic region overall.

The pilot implementation is driven initially by a relevant scientific problem or goal from one or more research groups who are
willing and able to commit a limited and defined amount of effort to working on
an one or more national e-infrastructure providers who can commit to supporting
an innovative or new mode of resource use on their systems.

The initial approach would be to carry out an extended functional exercise to define the scope of
each of the tasks, explore and define the problems and opportunities associated
with resources sharing, and identify any significant concerns or unique
opportunities. This would be followed by using a small set of selected test
cases to work through the basic requirements for resource sharing.

The outcomes would then be evaluated for further expansion or growth across the
e-infrastructure providers.
