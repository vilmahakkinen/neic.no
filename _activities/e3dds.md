The NeIC EISCAT_3D Technical support EISCAT_3D community on network, computing
and storage challenges.

[EISCAT_3D](https://eiscat3d.se) is an environmental research infrastructure on
the European ESFRI roadmap. It is proposed as an international research
infrastructure using the incoherent scatter technique to study the upper
atmosphere above the Arctic in order to investigate how the Earth's atmosphere
is coupled to space. EISCAT_3D is a multi-static phased array radar system that
will be installed at remote locations in the most Northern parts of the
Scandinavian peninsula. The system will be operated by and be an integral part
of the EISCAT Scientific Association.

The E3DDS project will design, simulate and prototype the data flow and computing
workflow from the antenna arrays of the upcoming EISCAT_3D radar sites to the
central storage and computing site.
The project will produce a set of requirements for the amount and type of
resources needed for the EISCAT_3D site and online computing. The simulation of
the site and online computing and data flow will provide a practical view and
experience of the software and hardware requirements. Also, the simulations will give
EISCAT_3D and the National e-infrastructure providers
a clearer view of the effort required for the production
EISCAT_3D online computing.
This will aid in the work to provide pricing levels for
effort required for the EISCAT_3D online e-infrastructure.
The project will give a
good view of the synergies between the EISCAT_3D e-infrastructure operations and
the NeIC Nordic Tier-1 Grid operations.
